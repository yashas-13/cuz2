# Advanced Supply Chain Management System

## Overview

This repository contains plans for an advanced, enterprise-level Supply Chain Management (SCM) system designed specifically for pharmaceutical manufacturers, Clearing & Forwarding Agents (CFAs), and stockists. The system ensures a tightly controlled in-house process flow where the Manufacturer retains authoritative oversight, with all CFA actions requiring explicit Manufacturer approval.

## Project Status

The repository now includes the initial Flask backend and a placeholder frontend structure.  Core modules, models, and routes are scaffolded, providing a working API for basic product and inventory management.  Further development will flesh out the remaining functionality.

## Key Functionalities

- **Manufacturer as Admin:**

  - Full administrative authority and audit access.
  - Approval gateway for all downstream processes initiated by CFA.
  - System-wide configuration access, including user role management, scheme setup, and batch tracking.

- **CFA (Clearing & Forwarding Agent):**

  - Role-restricted dashboard. All critical actions (stock update, dispatch) await manufacturer approval.
  - Live inventory sync with manufacturer database.
  - Order processing and logistics interface.

- **Stockists:**

  - Place and manage orders with real-time status.
  - View product availability and eligibility for offers.
  - Maintain a usage log for reorder forecasting.

## Installation and Setup

You can run the servers either manually or via the provided helper script.

### 1. Manual start

Run the following commands from the repository root:

```bash
# install backend dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# start the Flask API on http://localhost:5000
python -m backend.run &

# install frontend dependencies
npm install

# serve the static pages on http://localhost:8000
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000 &
cd ..
```

### 2. Helper script

Instead of manually running each command you can execute:

```bash
./setup_and_run.sh
```

The frontend's `api.js` module prefixes all requests with the backend URL. It
defaults to `http://localhost:5000`, but you can override this by defining a
`window.API_BASE` variable **before** loading `assets/js/api.js` when deploying
against a different backend address.

The script performs the same steps as above and launches both servers.

Once running, open `http://localhost:8000/pages/register.html` to register the
first manufacturer account or use the seeded credentials below to sign in via
`http://localhost:8000/pages/login.html`. The page will redirect to the
appropriate dashboard based on the authenticated user's role.  The backend seeds
a sample manufacturer account on first run:

  ```
  username: samplemanufacturer
  password: samplepass
  ```

## URL Health Check

To verify that both the backend API and frontend pages are reachable you can run
the helper script:

```sh
./scripts/curl_test_all.sh
```

By default it checks `http://localhost:5000` for API endpoints and
`http://localhost:8000` for frontend pages. Set the `BACKEND` or `FRONTEND`
environment variables to override the base URLs.
