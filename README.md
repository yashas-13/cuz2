# Advanced Supply Chain Management System

## Overview

This repository contains plans for an advanced, enterprise-level Supply Chain Management (SCM) system designed specifically for pharmaceutical manufacturers, Clearing & Forwarding Agents (CFAs), and stockists. The system ensures a tightly controlled in-house process flow where the Manufacturer retains authoritative oversight, with all CFA actions requiring explicit Manufacturer approval.

## Project Status

The repository now includes the initial Flask backend and a placeholder frontend structure.  Core modules, models, and routes are scaffolded, providing a working API for basic product and inventory management.  Further development will flesh out the remaining functionality.

## Key Functionalities

- **Manufacturer as Admin:**

  - Full administrative authority and audit access.
  - Approval gateway for all downstream processes initiated by CFA.
  - System-wide configuration access, including user role management, scheme setup, and batch tracking.

- **CFA (Clearing & Forwarding Agent):**

  - Role-restricted dashboard. All critical actions (stock update, dispatch) await manufacturer approval.
  - Live inventory sync with manufacturer database.
  - Order processing and logistics interface.

- **Stockists:**

  - Place and manage orders with real-time status.
  - View product availability and eligibility for offers.
  - Maintain a usage log for reorder forecasting.

## Installation and Setup

All dependencies can be installed and the development servers started with a
single helper script:

```sh
./setup_and_run.sh
```

The script installs the Python packages in `backend/`, installs the frontend
Node.js packages and then launches the Flask API on
`http://localhost:5000` and a simple static server for the frontend on
`http://localhost:8000`.

After running the script you can open `http://localhost:8000/pages/register.html`
to register the first manufacturer account.  The backend also seeds a sample
manufacturer account on first run:

  ```
  username: samplemanufacturer
  password: samplepass
  ```

## Authentication and Security

- JWT-based token validation
- Custom middleware for route-level role validation
- Token expiry and refresh pipeline
- All sensitive endpoints protected with layered access control

## Mobile-First Experience

- Tailored for mobile-first experience
- Toggle-based navigation drawer
- Toast/snackbar feedback for all interactions
- Lightweight and fast UI interactions

## Future Upgrades

- âœ… **Searchable Product Master with Barcode Generator**
- âœ… **Offline Sync with Local Storage Queue**
- ðŸ”œ **Role-based Notification Broadcast System**
